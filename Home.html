        In my free time, I love playing volleyball and video games, as they help me relax and stay active. I am also
        working on a project to analyze the potential of solar energy for residential use in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. When
        it comes to coding, I prefer keeping things simple and clear, focusing on languages like <strong>Java, C++, and
            Pyhton</strong>.
