            <h3>Atomic Habits by James Clear</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li><b><u>Summary</u></b><br>This book offers a practical guide to creating and sustaining habits that drive personal growth and success. Clear breaks down the science of behavior change into actionable steps, emphasizing the importance of starting small and being consistent. He introduces the "Four Laws of
                Behavior Change" (Cue, Craving, Response, Reward) to help readers develop better habits and eliminate negative ones.</li>
            <li><b><u>Review</u></b><br>Clear’s approach is straightforward and actionable, making the book highly practical for anyone looking to improve their daily routines. Its clear explanations and real-world
                examples make it accessible, although some readers may find the repetition of concepts slightly overemphasized. It’s an excellent resource for self-improvement enthusiasts.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li><b><u>Summary</u></b><br>This book focuses on overcoming self-sabotage and emotional blockages to realize personal potential. Wiest uses the metaphor of a mountain to represent internal challenges and
                provides tools to conquer them through self-reflection, emotional intelligence, and actionable steps. The book emphasizes that personal growth is often about facing and embracing one’s vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><b><u>Review</u></b><br>Wiest writes in a reflective and motivational tone, which resonates deeply with readers who are introspective. The book blends psychology and personal development, but its abstract
                style may not appeal to those seeking a more structured approach. It's ideal for readers on a journey of self-discovery and healing.</li>

            <h3>To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li><b><u>Summary</u></b><br>This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is a powerful critique of racial injustice in 1930s Alabama. Narrated by Scout Finch, it follows her father, Atticus, as he defends Tom Robinson, a
                Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. The story explores themes of empathy, morality, and the loss of innocence through the eyes of children witnessing adult prejudices.</li>
            <li><b><u>Review</u></b><br>Harper Lee’s storytelling is poignant, with richly developed characters and a strong moral core. Its timeless themes make it a staple of American literature, though some may find its
                slower pacing challenging. The novel remains a profound exploration of human rights and ethics, making it essential reading for all ages.</li>
